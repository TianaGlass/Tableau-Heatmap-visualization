# Tableau-Heatmap-visualization
 The heat map visualization is showing  FFM (Federally Facilitated Market)  states with &lt;150 FPL(Federal Poverty Line) population. I then ranked the highest counties by the highest percent of FPL Population.  This Heat map was created to  inform their media buys for uninsured low-income individuals who can get a $0 plan from healthcare.gov!
